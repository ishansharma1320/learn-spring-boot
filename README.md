# SECTION 1

## MAVEN WRAPPER

Each spring initializer project comes with a maven wrapper which can be used to run maven commands without it being
installed in the system

1. `./mvnw package # used to create a packaged java file which can be run using java -jar and is stored in the target directory`
2. `./mvnw spring-boot:run # used to run spring boot app from the CLI`

## Some Starter Packages

1. spring-boot-devtools: a package like nodemon, auto reloading on code update
2. spring-boot-starter-actuator: exposes useful endpoints that helps in app performance monitoring
3. spring-boot-starter-security: used to add an authentication layer
